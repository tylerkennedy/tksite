Your timeline is probably plagued with them too.\nAnd if you are anything like me, you have started getting annoyed with most of these threads with click-bait titles and nonsense disguised as knowledge.\nWhy Are There So Many Threads on Twitter The reason threads have become so popular on Twitter is large accounts using them as a growth hack. The Twitter algorithm gives more engagement to threads because they bait people into clicking and opening the threads. This signals to Twitter that people want to see the threads so they are prioritized being shown on the timeline.\nPower users figured out this trick and started churning out threads to drive engagement and grow their Twitter following. People have started selling Twitter growth courses telling people how to write threads to get more followers.\nAnd some are writing Twitter threads about writing Twitter threads ü§Ø\nHow to write a top 1% Twitter thread:\nüßµ\n‚Äî Justin Welsh (@thejustinwelsh) June 20, 2022  I don‚Äôt blame people using threads to grow their Twitter accounts. Because if it works, it works and why wouldn‚Äôt you use all of the tools available to grow your business and market yourself. Instead, Twitter needs to nerf threads in their algorithm.\nFor now, I just want a way to hide these threads from my timeline.\nI come to Twitter for easy to consume content in the form of 140 280 characters. I do not want to see long form content in the shape of massive threads of tweets.\nHow To Mute Twitter Threads üßµ Twitter gives its users the option to mute tweets from specific accounts or mute tweets that contain specific words. When trying to hide tweet threads, muting accounts is not very helpful.\nMuting an account on Twitter will hide all tweets that come from that account. This is no good if you still want to see some tweets from them, just not their threads.\nInstead, you want to hide threads by muting tweets from all accounts that use the word ‚Äòthread‚Äô. You can mute words from your timeline on both Twitter‚Äôs website and their mobile apps for iPhone and Android.\nHow To Mute Words on Twitter Web or Mobile The steps for muting words on the Twitter Web client or mobile apps are available on Twitter‚Äôs help center website but here is a quick summary:\n  Go to your account Settings and privacy\n  Click Privacy and safety\n  Tap Mute and block\n  Click Muted words\n  Tap Add to create a new muted word\n  Enter the word you want to mute. I suggest using ‚Äòthread‚Äô and ‚Äòüßµ‚Äô\n  Select to enable muting from the Home timeline\n  Choose to only mute from people you don‚Äôt follow or from everyone\n  Press Save\n  That‚Äôs all it takes. Now you should stop seeing tweet threads on your timeline! If you‚Äôre still seeing threads, you can tweak this list and add more words you want muted.\nPros and Cons of Muting Words on Twitter A handy feature of muting words or accounts is that they sync across your Twitter account. So tweets and words are muted on any device that you log into with your Twitter account.\nThere is however a downside of muting words to hide threads on Twitter.\nYou might not be able to block every single thread. If someone writes a thread of tweets but doesn‚Äôt include the word ‚Äòthread‚Äô or one of the other words that you muted, you will still see the thread.\nFor some people, the good enough solution is fine. But if you cannot stand to see another thread on Twitter, you might need a more robust way of blocking threads.\nHow To Hide Twitter Threads With a Chrome Extension To make sure that you hide every last tweet thread on your timeline, you need something more powerful than muting words on Twitter.\nI felt the same way so I created a free Chrome extension to block threads on Twitter called No More Threads.\nYou can install the No More Threads Chrome Extension for free from the Chrome Web store. No More Threads will hide threads from your Twitter timeline whenever you browse Twitter using Google Chrome.\nWhen you are on Twitter, you will see a switch that allows you to hide threads from your timeline. When the toggle is enabled, threads will be hidden. If you change your mind and want to see tweet threads again, click the toggle to turn it off and threads will reappear on your Twitter timeline.\nThe No More Threads extension is available to install for free from the Chrome Web Store and if you find it useful leaving a 5 star review would be much appreciated ‚≠êÔ∏è.\n",
