There are hundreds of templates available to use with Carrd. Templates make it even easier to build your website because you can skip the daunting task of designing your landing page from scratch. 

With a template, you start with a pre-filled canvas that you can customize to fit your liking. You can easily change the colors and font or swap out images and text with your app name and icon.

Using templates with Carrd will save you tons of time building your new website and make it easy to get a cool and clean design.

### Affordability

You can get started using Carrd for free and even publish your website on the free plan. If you want to publish your site on your own domain, you will need to upgrade to a paid pro plan.

However, Carrd is extremely affordable with plans starting at only **$9 per year**. Pair that with a low cost domain name from [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com/) or [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) and you can have yourself a website for less than $30 per year!

Many templates for Carrd are available for free and there are some available for purchase, but they are usually less than $20. You will find that this is much more affordable than Wordpress or Webflow themes that can easily cost over $100!
