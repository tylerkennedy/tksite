If you're looking for a free and easy way to build a website, use [Carrd.co](https://try.carrd.co/1zf1rsmd). 

Carrd.co is a simple yet powerful website builder that allows you to design and create a professional website in minutes. I've built a collection of Carrd.co templates that you can use to build your next website. 

Templates provide a starting point with a pre-built design and layout. This allows you to customize the look and feel of your website and avoid getting stuck when you are just getting started. So, no more staring at a blank page. Add a few tweaks and your website is ready to launch. 

Using a website template also saves you time and money. If you don't know how to code or have an eye for design, you won't have to hire a web designer or developer to create a website for you. 

These templates will save you time and get your site launched faster. Each template is built with these features in mind:

* Responsive design so your site looks good on desktop and mobile devices. 

* Drop-in [analytics](/blog/how-to-add-google-analytics-to-carrd-website/) to make it easy to track how much traffic your site gets. 

* Optimized for Google to help your SEO efforts and rank higher in search.

Grab a template and customize it by adding your own content and change the design to match your liking.
